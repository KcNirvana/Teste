    This flow is very similar to wizard_script_account_flow, but removes all the restoration from
    account components and inserts a screen with instructions on how to migrate from iOs

    The wizard:uris recorded here have the inconvenience of being generated by hand, but they allow
    for the full spread of launch flags (we need FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK [0x10000000]), where the
    <intent> tag processed by Intent.parseIntent() does not.

     adb shell am to-intent-uri -a com.android.setupwizard.WELCOME -f 0x10000000 \-\-ez firstRun true
